        <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
        <p>
            SSL is a security protocol developed by Netscape to ensure security and confidentiality during information transfer over the network. 
            With the release of version 3.0 in 1996, it has become a standard supported by almost all Internet browsers (Microsoft Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and has found a wide range of applications. 
            It ensures that it can be decrypted absolutely and only at the correct address. 
            Information is automatically encrypted before being sent and can only be decrypted by the correct recipient. 
            By verifying on both sides, the confidentiality and integrity of the transaction and information are protected. 
            The strength of the encryption method used in the data stream depends on the key length used. 
            Key length is very important for protecting information. 
            For example; A transmission over 8 bits is extremely easy to decode.
            Bit refers to a number of binary counting system.
        </p>

        <p>
            A bit can take two different values: 0 or 1. 8 bits contain only 2 to the 8 = 256 possible different keys. 
            A computer can reach a conclusion by examining these 256 different possibilities in sequence. 
            A malicious person would have to spend 134 years after investing $2 million to decipher a 256-bit password. 
            As can be seen from this example, the SSL security system provides complete and absolute protection. 
            128 bit and 256 bit encryption are most commonly used in the SSL protocol. 
            256 bit encryption technology is available on our site.
