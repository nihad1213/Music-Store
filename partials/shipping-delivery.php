        <h2>IMPORTANT!</h2>
        <p>
        Regarding international orders, Chic Cargo has recently changed its price calculation system and there are widely varying prices for each country. We have defined postal prices for as many countries as we can, but there are many countries where we have not defined a price! If you cannot choose your country of residence when checking out, send us an e-mail and we will try to help.
